LogicHex Examples
=================

Plain text renditions of configurations I found interesting for LogicHex.

LogicHex was created by Notch / Markus Persson, of Minecraft and Mojang
fame.  This project and its authors are not affiliated with Notch or
Mojang, so don't contact them for help if something here doesn't work.
